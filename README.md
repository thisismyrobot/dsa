# Data Structures and Algorithms

It recently came to my attention that my skills on the maths-side of DSAs
(from a decade ago) were __significantly__ behind where I thought they were
and, frankly, where they should be.

This repo will hold a examples that I'm going to work through, including a
number of tests to "prove" best- and worst-case complexities etc. as I refresh
and develop my DSA knowledge and skills.

There's no licensing here, this is free code that should work, and maybe
someone else out there will find some of this useful too.
