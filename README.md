# Data Structures and Algorithms

It recently came to my attention that my skills with the "maths" side of DSAs
(Big-O etc, learnt a decade ago) were __significantly__ behind where I thought
they were and, frankly, where they should be.

This repo. will hold worked examples of DSAs, tests and graphs to "prove"
complexity cases as I refresh and develop my DSA knowledge and skills.

There's [no licensing here](UNLICENCE), just freely-usable code that you might
also find useful.

## Time complexities

Aiming to look at these three [time complexities](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
initially:

* Search
* Insertion
* Deletion

## Tests

Requires py.test. Run py.test from repository root.

## Requires

I'm using py.test for testing and matplotlib (and its dependencies) for the
graphs.

## Graphs

Generate using:

    python time_complexity_graphs.py

from within 'src'. This takes a little while.
