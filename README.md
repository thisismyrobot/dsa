# Data Structures and Algorithms

It recently came to my attention that my skills on the maths-side of DSAs
(from a decade ago) were __significantly__ behind where I thought they were
and, frankly, where they should be.

This repo will hold worked examples of DSAs and tests to "prove" best- and
worst-case complexities etc. as I refresh and develop my DSA knowledge and
skills.

There's [no licensing here](UNLICENCE), just freely-usable code that you might
also find useful.

## Time complexities

Aiming to look at [these four time complexities](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
initially:

    * Access
    * Search
    * Insertion
    * Deletion

## Tests

Requires py.test. Run py.test from repository root.
