# Data Structures and Algorithms

It recently came to my attention that my skills on the maths-side of DSAs
(from a decade ago) were __significantly__ behind where I thought they were
and, frankly, where they should be.

This repo will hold worked examples of DSAs and tests (graphs) to "prove"
best- and worst-case complexities etc. as I refresh and develop my DSA
knowledge and skills.

There's [no licensing here](UNLICENCE), just freely-usable code that you might
also find useful.

## Time complexities

Aiming to look at [these three time complexities](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
initially:

* Search
* Insertion
* Deletion

## Tests

Requires py.test. Run py.test from repository root.

## Requires

I'm using py.test for testing and matplotlib (and its dependencies) for the
graphs.

## Graphs

Generate using:

    python time_complexity_graphs.py

from within 'src'.
