# Data Structures and Algorithms

It recently came to my attention that my skills on the maths-side of DSAs
(from a decade ago) were __significantly__ behind where I thought they were
and, frankly, where they should be.

This repo will hold worked examples of DSAs and tests to "prove" best- and
worst-case complexities etc. as I refresh and develop my DSA knowledge and
skills.

There's [no licensing here](UNLICENCE), this is free code that should work,
and maybe someone else out there will find some of this useful too.

## Tests

Requires py.test. Run py.test from repository root.

The tests should result in a close fit to [this](http://bigocheatsheet.com/).
