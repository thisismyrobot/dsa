# Data Structures and Algorithms

It recently came to my attention that my skills with the "maths" side of DSAs
(Big-O etc, learnt a decade ago) were __significantly__ behind where I thought
they were and, frankly, where they should be.

This repo. will hold worked and tested examples of DSAs as I refresh and
develop my DSA knowledge and skills.

There's [no licensing here](UNLICENCE), just freely-usable code that you might
also find useful.

## Tests

Requires py.test. Run py.test from repository root.

## Requires

I'm using py.test for testing.
